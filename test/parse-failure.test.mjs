/**
 * V8 embeds the input in its own parse error message, so the message cannot be
 * passed on. `parseFailureDetail` is the guard, and the branch ORDER is the
 * whole guard: nineteen of thirty-eight tools in this catalog shipped a helper
 * that looked for `at position N` first, and a document whose text reads
 * `at position 1` then matched inside the quoted span and was sliced back out.
 *
 * Every case below is one of those shapes, asserted twice: against the helper,
 * and through the real report path, because the helper is only useful where it
 * is actually called.
